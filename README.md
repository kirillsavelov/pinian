# Pinian

**Pinian** is a collection of essential plugins for [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), the official state management library for Vue.js. The name "Pinian" playfully combines "Pinia" with the idea of "and" â€” inspired by the familiar "M&M's" style.

This monorepository provides a variety of extensions designed to streamline state management and data persistence, making it easier to enhance your Pinia-based applications.
