# Pinian

**Pinian** is a collection of essential plugins for [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), the official state management
library for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). The name "Pinian" playfully combines "Pinia" with the idea of "and" â€” inspired by the familiar "

performance and can be fully customized to fit your needs.
