# Pinian

**Pinian** is a collection of essential plugins for [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), the official state management
library for Vue.js. The name "Pinian" playfully combines "Pinia" with the idea of "and" â€” inspired by the familiar "
M&M's" style.

This collection extends Pinia's capabilities with carefully crafted plugins that solve common state management
challenges in Pinia-based applications.
